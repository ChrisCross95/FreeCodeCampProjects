        <p class="tribute_paragraph">My mother is the strongest and most authentic person I know <br>
        She was born in Milkwaukee, Wisconsin, though she, like most of <br>
        our family, have strong roots in central Mississipi. As one of six <br>
        children (and the youngest of three sisters), my mother developed <br>
        sharp people skills eary on: she is as intuitive and discerning in <br>
        her analysis of indivuduals and social dynamics as the most seasoned <br>
        sociologist or clinical psychologist. My mother has always been <br>
        honest in her opinion, true to her word, and relentless in her  <br>
        advocacy for lifelong education and personal development.</p>

        <p class="tribute_paragraph">My mother became pregnant with me at the tender age of fifteen, <br>
           and gave birth to me the same year: 1995. During this period and <br>
           all that followed, she embodied the pride, work ethic, and <br>
           entrepreneurialisme of our family, which has included <br>
           public servants, machanists, and even moonshiners! Following paths <br>
           beaten by millions of African Americans before her, she ventured <br>
           north, to the industrial city of Fort Wayne, Indiana, where she <br>
           worked tirelessly, thanklessly, and with little support to provide <br>
           me with a firm and stable foundation from which to grow and explore. <br>
           She left behind the familiarity of childhood settings and welcoming <br>
           communiites to face the stings of racism and exclusion in a distant <br>
           city. </p>
